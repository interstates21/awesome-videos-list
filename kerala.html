      <P>Kerala is one of the most beautiful place in the southern part of India and is generally called as God's Own Country.  This southern state of India is famous for its greenish and scenic beauty, which attracts a lot of tourists every year. Kerala has many specialties and places to see such as hill stations, beaches, backwaters, villages, pilgrimage centers, rivers etc which makes it one of the most visited tourist destinations in India.</P>
    <P>According to Hindu mythology, Kerala was created by Lord Parasurama, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu by throwing his axe across the sea to create a new land for his devotees to live peacefully. So, Kerala is God's own creation, hence it is called God's own country!.  Every nook and corner in Kerala you will see Hindu temples, Muslim mosques and Christian Churches: and unlike many other parts of India, people live happily without communal riots and great religious tolerance.  Hence it is God's own country full of worship places.
    </P>
    <P>Nestled between the pristine waters of the Arabian sea on the west and the lush western Ghat mountains on the east, its intense network of rivers and lagoons, thick forests, exotic wildlife, tranquil stretches of emerald backwaters and a long shoreline of serene beaches make it a traveler's paradise. God's own country! 
    </P>
